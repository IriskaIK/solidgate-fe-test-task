# Solidgate Frontend Test Task

## Overview
This project is a frontend implementation of a payment page for Solidgate's test task. The goal was to accurately replicate the provided design using React while ensuring proper form validation, error handling, and a simulated payment process.

## Tech Stack
- **React** + **Vite**
- **TypeScript**
- **CSS** for styling
- **Client-side form validation**
- **Adaptive design** (implemented)

## Features
1. **Design Reproduction**: The UI closely matches the given reference design, ensuring an accurate representation of elements and details.
2. **Data Entry Form**: A simple form simulating a payment page, including input fields for card details with client-side validation.
3. **Payment Simulation**: On form submission, a simulated success message appears, mimicking a successful transaction without real payment gateway integration.
4. **Error Handling**: Proper messages and indicators for common user errors (e.g., invalid input, missing fields).
5**Responsive Design**: The page is adaptive and works across various screen sizes.
